# Curve - authentication and encryption library

Curve implements the [CurveZMQ](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:26) elliptic curve security mechanism, for use in ZeroMQ applications. This library is primarily a reference implementation for the CurveZMQ specification but may also be used for end-to-end security.

The ZeroMQ core library has its own implementation of CurveZMQ over TCP, since July 2013. The Curve library is intended:

* To facilitate CurveZMQ implementations in other languages by providing a reference implementation.
* To provide security for older versions of ZeroMQ.
* To provide end-to-end security over untrusted intermediaries, for instance between two chat clients connected over a public ZeroMQ-based chat server.
* To provide security over other transports that fit the one-to-one model (it will not work over multicast).

CurveZMQ creates encrypted sessions ("connections") between two peers using short term keys that it securely exchanges using long term keys. When the session is over, both sides discard their short term keys, rendering the encrypted data unreadable, even if the long term keys are captured. It is not designed for long term encryption of data. 

The design of CurveZMQ stays as close as possible to the security handshake of [CurveCP](http://curvecp.org), a protocol designed to run over UDP.

NOTE: CurveCP, CurveZMQ and the Curve library are considered EXPERIMENTAL and NOT PROVEN FOR PRODUCTION USE. Like all new security protocols, the code needs review and time to be considered mature. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. The authors make NO PROMISES or guarantees about the level of security this protocol or code offers you.

## Contributing

This project uses the [C4.1 (Collective Code Construction Contract)](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22) process for contributions.

This project uses the [CLASS (C Language Style for Scalabilty)](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:21) guide for code style.

## Dependencies

This project needs these projects:

* libsodium - git://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.git
* libzmq - git://github.com/zeromq/libzmq.git
* libczmq - git://github.com/zeromq/czmq.git

## Building and Installing

This project uses autotools for packaging. To build from git you must first build libsodium, libzmq, and libczmq. The simplest way currently is to get these directly from GitHub. All example commands are for Linux:

    #   libsodium
    git clone git://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.git
    cd libsodium
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure && make check
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig
    cd ..

    #   libzmq
    git clone git://github.com/zeromq/libzmq.git
    cd libzmq
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure && make check
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig
    cd ..

    #   CZMQ
    git clone git://github.com/zeromq/czmq.git
    cd czmq
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure && make check
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig
    cd ..

    git clone git://github.com/zeromq/libcurve.git
    cd libcurve
    sh autogen.sh
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure && make check
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig
    cd ..

You will need the libtool and autotools packages. On FreeBSD, you may need to specify the default directories for configure:

    ./configure --with-libzmq=/usr/local

## Linking with an Application

Include `curve.h` in your application and link with libcurve. Here is a typical gcc link command:

    gcc -lcurve -lsodium -lzmq -lczmq myapp.c -o myapp

## Documentation

All documentation is provided in the doc/ subdirectory.
